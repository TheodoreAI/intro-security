Observations and comments on the Bloom Filter:

I made this Bloom Filter so I can reuse it on an application 
that will let the user know if the password they are inputting is likely 
to be in a dictionary file or has been exposed before. 

I noticed that the lower the false positive probability (p << 0.5), the bigger the bit size array had to be. 
I think that in order for the low false positive property to remain, the bit size array has to increase proportionally.
I also noticed that when I use a dictionary list to insert into the Bloom Filter, the false positive outcomes depends on the size. 
I could not gather what the relationship was from just this, I think I would need to run more tests, but 
for the purposes of this assignment this should suffice. 

The bloom filter meets the following:

1. It does not report False Negatives
2. For the sample_input.txt it does not yield all maybes when the dictionary.txt is used as the data source to compare to.
