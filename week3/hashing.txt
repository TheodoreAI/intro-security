I find it interesting that keeping a product secure depends on a lot of factors, including trusting that the consumers will do their part in keeping it secure. For example, let's say that a company wants all their consumers to have secure passwords while using their products. The company can do things like require the password to be at least a certain length, contain special characters, be changed every few months, etc. However, the consumer can still insist on having an easy to guess password like "Password1234!!". It seems to me like cybersecurity requires thinking about two major things: what adversarys will do to hack into a product and what consumers will do to inadvertently make it easier for adversaries to take advantage of them.
