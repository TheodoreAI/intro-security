Part 1a: response to the prompt: 
    I chose cybersecurity because I want to learn about ciphers and the encryption methods and how to apply them. I found the last discussion post really interesting because I didn't know you could use openssl to encipher things. Now I know all the different methods of enciphering plaintext and the resources to find the enciphering methods. I am also interested in RSA, primarily because of the mathematics behind it. I went over this week's lecture on RSA and while I was enthusiastic about it, I also found it difficult to follow the mathematics behind it. I like using RSA, as I have used it in the past to connect to remote servers and I like how tech savvy it feels. I also know about Shor's algorithm that can be ran using a quantum computer to theoretically be able to crack RSA. For the general public, not sure how feasible implementing Shor's algorithm is as of now, maybe in industry. 

I also want to learn the field's vernacular and know how to use some of the standard procedures for implementing secure systems. I think this would make me a better software developer and a conscious programmer. For the future, I hope to work in cybersecurity and I like to think I have the cybersecurity mind for it, but I lack the resources and tech expertise. I think working in this field would be rewarding because I like to encipher things. I like writing things in code, I have been learning American Sign Language with my significant other because I like the idea of talking to each other in a language that not a lot of our peers know.

    hashed file (hold the hash value of the content in plaintext.txt): plaintext.txt   Download plaintext.txt  

    Command lines needed to confirm the hash value:

    step1: get the hash value:     openssl dgst -sha256 plaintext.tx

    step3: confirm hash value from above
