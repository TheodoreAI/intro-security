Decryption:

For AES use the following command: it seems like the code has to be decoded because at first it will be in base64.

    openssl aes-192-ecb -md md5 -in aes192ecb.enc -out aes_output.txt -base64


Then use:

    openssl aes-192-ecb -d -in aes192ecb.enc -out aes_output.txt

Encryption/Decryption of mine:

    ENC: (-p gives you the key, iv, salt)
    openssl aes-256-cbc -in plaintext.txt -out aes256cbc.enc -p
    DEC:
    openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in aes256cbc.enc -out plaintext2.txt
